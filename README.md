# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

This project is designed to create a working online Portfolio for the purpose to showcase the many projects created by myself. With this, I will not only be able access projects I have completed via the web, but also have anyone interested in viewing these projects do the same.

The soul reason for this page is to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for future employeers.

## Credits

I used a variety of images not taken or owned by myself however, correctly labeled under their title description. Otherwise, I constructed and built this webpage all on my own with wireframe designing on how I wanted the page to be formatted.
